## Trading Strategies
CryptoBots currently includes the strategies listed below.

<details>
  <summary><b>Cash and carry bot</b></summary>
    This bot seeks to earn perpetual futures funding rates whilst in a hedged position, by
    buying a token on the spot market, and shorting the perpetual future of the token. This
    protects against price volatility, whilst capturing the funding rate paid out by the
    perpetual futures market.<br>
    To identify potential tokens to trade with this strategy, use <code>cryptobots cash-and-carry</code>.
    You will see something like this:<br>

    <br>From here, you will be asked if you want to deploy a bot to take advantage of these opportunities!
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>EMA crossover trading bot</b></summary>
    This bot will trade trends by using the EMA crossover strategy. Below are some backtest
    results on ETH.<br>

  <summary><b>Grid Bot</b></summary>
    This bot will buy and/or sell at set grid levels. When you expect market conditions
    to be choppy and sideways-moving, a long/short grid works best. In this scenario, the
    bot will buy when price dips, and sell when price rises. When you expect the market to
    be trending (up or down!), a one-directional grid works best. In this case, the bot 
    will act as a trend-follower with a trailing stop loss at each new grid level.
    Below is a backtest from running the grid bot in long trend mode on ETH/USDT 
    perpetual from February 1st to March 9th 2024.<br>
